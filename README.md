# Disciple of Land

I deemed existing gathering timers to be inadequate, so I made my own.

This is currently still missing a lot of functionality and data.

## 1.0 checklist

- [x] Displaying gathering nodes
- [x] Displaying next time gathering node will be available
- [x] Displaying gathering node type
- [x] Displaying node's items and their level
- [x] Sorting based on time when node will be available
- [ ] Filter and sorting section/popup
- [ ] Filtering based on job
- [ ] Filtering based on scrip type
- [ ] Filtering based on items
- [ ] Filtering based on level
- [ ] Filtering based on node type (legendary, ephemeral, etc.)
- [ ] Fully input level 80-90 nodes data

## Nice to have checklist
- [ ] Fully input level 70-80 nodes data
- [ ] Fully input level 60-70 nodes data
- [ ] Fully input level 50-60 nodes data
- [ ] Better mobile support (pwa?)
